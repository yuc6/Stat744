# Data description
The data of this assignment is coming from https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/188/9/1733/5525028. This article analyses the impact and effectiveness of state-level tuberculosis interventions in four different locations. The data is from Table 3 in this paper. The original table shows the projected yields of targeted testing and teatment for tuberculosis in California, Florida, New York, and Texas. It provides data point estimate and 95% confidence interval of different risk type froups from the simulation study.

       + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=LL,ymax=UL))
       + facet_grid(location~info.type)
)

# Comments on Plot
This plot shows etimation of people been affeted under different risk types.The dots stands for point estimates and bars for 95% confidence intervals. Different colors are used to distinguish between different groups. The main disadvantage of this plot is that the information on x-axis cannot be shown clearly. Since the label on x-axis is used to indicate risk types. So the variable is discrete on x-axis. The first two groups of data, which are no. of completing LTBI treatment and no. of active TB diagnosis is laying between a relatively shorter interval compared to no. of person screened. Especially for no. of completing LTBI, we cannot find the difference between risk types obviously.
