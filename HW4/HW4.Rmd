The data is from a study which is trying to determine a drug called "dobutamine" coud be used for a test to measuring a patient's risk of having a heart attack, or "cardiac event". The datasets includes information of patient's gender, age and dose of dobutamine, etc. The response variable Y is a binary variable which indicates if any cardiac events happend in the next year.

Here is the website where I find the data: http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets.

I bulit a model. In which the response variable Y has a Binomial distribution. The probability of occurance of event is assumed linearly related to dose, age and gender.

JD: Make sure your code runs from beginning to end in a _new_ session (don't forget library statements)

Here is my code:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(effects)
dd <- read.csv("stressEcho.csv")
event<- dd$any.event
y <- 1-event
## since 0 means event occured in the dataser, so changed it to 1 for positive, 0 for negative
dose <- dd$dose
age <- dd$age
gender <- dd$gender
model<-glm(y ~ dose+age+gender,family="binomial")
summary(model)
plot(allEffects(model))
```
The plot shows effects of those three predictors on the response variable. As we can see, dose has a positive effect on the event. Women seems have a higher risk of heart attack than men. However, age seems to have a negative effect on the response.

JD: Your plots don't really illustrate inference -- and in fact, what you report seems incorrect, since you imply that the dose effect is significant. Finally, I don't understand at all why you would use past heart attacks as a response variable. Is the theory that maybe they had a heart attack because they were going to be given a higher dose in a future trial?
